                    <li>Traditional programming has been the backbone of software development for decades, with programmers manually creating rules and logic to solve various problems.</li>
                    <li>Traditional programming languages typically take data and (business or solution) rules as input and apply the rules to the data in order to come up with answers as output.</li>
                    <li>The programmer is responsible for creating and implementing the rules and logic of the program, ensuring it works correctly for all possible input cases.</li>

                <ul class="why-matter">
                    <li>The traditional programming paradigm is quite good and human intelligence and domain expertise is definitely an important factor in making data-driven decisions.</li>
                    <li>We need Machine Learning to make faster and better decisions.</li>
                    <li>The Machine Learning paradigm tries to take into account data and expected outputs or results if any and uses the computer to build the program, which is also known as a model.</li>
                    <li>This program or model can then be used in the future to make necessary decisions and give expected outputs from new inputs.</li>

                    <li>A machine learning model is a program that can find patterns or make decisions from a previously unseen dataset.</li>
                    <li>Feed these input and output pairs to any specific Machine Learning algorithm in your computer and build a model that learns inherent device patterns and observes the corresponding output or outcome.</li>
                    <li>Deploy this model such that for newer values of device attributes it can predict if a specific device is behaving normally or it might cause a potential outage.</li>
